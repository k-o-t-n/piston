I am a big fan of the original Mirror's Edge. The game introduced some fresh gameplay mechanics, great level design, and a unique aesthetic that brought the game world alive.
 
Mirror's Edge Catalyst manages to retain the essence of the original's art style, with some nice additions (real-time day/night cycles anyone?) that bring it nicely into the current generation. The screenshots and cherry-picked gameplay segments released as marketing do a great job of compelling you to play this game; to explore the world they've created.
 
It's a shame that the rest of the game is a complete mess. The story and characters are an absolute bore-fest, the transition to open-world will leave you wondering "but...why?", the "social" integration is a complete waste of time, but most importantly, it's **just not fun to play**. If you're looking for Mirror's Edge 2, this is not it.
