Transistor is a game that initially passed me by. Despite having much love for Bastion, I didn't feel compelled to check out Transistor when it released. What a mistake.

Transistor is a beautiful game, in every aspect. It looks stunning, runs smoothly, and contains a ridiculous level of polish. Early on, I upgraded the starter function **Breach()** with newly-unlocked **Switch()**. The first time I used this combo, the little hearts that came tumbling out of the familiar **Breach()** FX made me stop and smile. This attention to detail is present throughout the game, and I just can't get enough of it.

Not only does Transistor look amazing, it plays amazing. The gameplay systems are well thought out, and provide a surprising amount of depth. The sheer amount of different function combinations really do let you play the game in a variety of different ways. Customising your function loadout is great fun, and trialling out your new build on the next wave of enemies can be incredibly satisfying. There's very little in the way of hand-holding, particularly when it comes to slotting your functions, which is refreshing. I don't want to be told how to play a game; I want to learn by playing, something that most modern games just don't get right.

Being able to instantly drop into a turn adds yet more depth. When you're feeling overwhelmed in real-time combat, you have the ability to completely freeze time and plan out your next set of moves, in a **Turn()**. This whole turn system is super slick, and frankly a joy to use. There are a bunch of other mechanics and systems in play, but I won't touch on them here. Oh, and the boss fights are awesome too!

To top everything off, Transistor has an intriguing plot told through a compelling narrative. It won't cram it's story and metaphors down your throat; but it will provide enough snippets of backstory to get your brain ticking. It's done cleverly and told wonderfully - truly great stuff. Complementing all of this is the incredible sound work. The music is gorgeous, the game sounds are masterful, and the voice acting is unexpectedly good.

Transistor is superb. Transistor reminds me why I love video games. Play Transistor.
